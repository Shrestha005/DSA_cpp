DSA:

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. In Sort an array of 0's 1's & 2's | The optimal solution is called Dutch National Flag Algorithm

2. In Majority Element | The optimal approach is called Moore's Voting Algorithm

3. Maximum Subarray Sum | The optimal approach is called Kadane's Algorithm

4. Middle Node of a LL | Loop Detection in LL | The optimal approach is called Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (or the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm)
